## üìñ Overview

- **Goal:** Learn optimal policies for a 5√ó5 GridWorld using on-policy (Sarsa) and off-policy (Q-learning) methods.  
- **Action selection:** Œµ-greedy (Œµ = 0.1)  
- **Training:** 300 episodes, Œ± = 0.5, Œ≥ = 0.95  
- **Outputs:**  
  - Optimal policy grids  
  - Trajectories under greedy policy  
  - Reward-per-episode plots  
  - PNG files for inclusion in the report
